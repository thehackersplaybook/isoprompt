## 1. **Objective**

Incorporate prompt engineering best practices, diagnostic feedback, and advanced patterns described in Sikha et al. (2023) into IsoPrompt as configurable features. Empower users to create, refine, and diagnose high-quality prompts using evidence-based guidance.

---

## 2. **Scope**

- **Prompt pattern modes:** Offer explicit support for standard prompt engineering patterns (e.g., Chain of Thought, Role, Few-shot, Format-constrained, Bias-aware).
- **Prompt diagnostics:** Provide feedback and suggestions for improving prompt clarity, bias, context, and specificity.
- **Iterative workflow:** Enable users to iteratively refine prompts with in-context feedback.
- **Persona-based templates:** Offer tailored templates for different user personas (e.g., Developer, Business Analyst, Executive, Personal User).
- **Bias/fairness/security scanning:** Warn and suggest improvements for prompts with ethical, privacy, or security issues.

---

## 3. **API Additions**

### **Python SDK**

#### **Signature Update**

```python
def optimize_prompt(
    user_input: str,
    ...,
    pattern: Optional[str] = None,     # e.g. "chain_of_thought", "role", etc.
    diagnostics: bool = False,         # Enable prompt diagnostics and feedback
    persona: Optional[str] = None,     # User role/persona
    bias_check: bool = False,          # Scan for bias/fairness issues
    security_check: bool = False,      # Scan for prompt injection/data leakage
    iterative: bool = False,           # Enable iterative refinement loop
    ...,
) -> str:
    ...
```

#### **Example Usage**

```python
# Chain-of-thought with bias/fairness diagnostics and business persona
optimize_prompt(
    "Summarize the impact of renewable energy on urban infrastructure.",
    pattern="chain_of_thought",
    diagnostics=True,
    bias_check=True,
    persona="business_professional",
    security_check=True,
    iterative=True,
)
```

---

### **CLI**

- `--pattern` (string, choices: chain_of_thought, role, few_shot, format, bias_aware, etc.)
- `--diagnostics`
- `--persona` (personal, developer, business_analyst, executive, etc.)
- `--bias-check`
- `--security-check`
- `--iterative`

**Example:**

```bash
isoprompt --prompt "Analyze the health record for risks." --pattern chain_of_thought --diagnostics --bias-check --persona executive --security-check --iterative
```

---

## 4. **Prompt Patterns and Templates**

- Maintain a library of templates for:

  - Chain of Thought (CoT)
  - Role Prompting (e.g., “You are an expert... Please…”)
  - Few-shot Prompting
  - Format-Constrained Prompting
  - Bias-Aware Prompting (explicitly neutral framing)

- Support combining patterns (e.g., “CoT + format constraint”).

---

## 5. **Prompt Diagnostics & Feedback Engine**

- **Feedback provided if `diagnostics=True`:**

  - Clarity: “Prompt is ambiguous, consider adding context.”
  - Context: “Prompt lacks detail—add background for more relevant output.”
  - Bias: “Potential gender bias detected; use neutral terms.”
  - Security: “Prompt may allow prompt injection.”
  - Length: “Prompt may exceed LLM context window.”
  - Persona: “Prompt doesn’t match ‘executive’ style; consider summary format.”

- **Return suggestions or even auto-fix options.**

---

## 6. **Iterative Refinement Loop**

- If `iterative=True`, allow user to:

  - See initial output and feedback
  - Modify and re-submit prompt, with cumulative feedback/history
  - Compare outputs from each iteration

---

## 7. **Persona Templates**

- Offer prompt starter templates based on persona (e.g., "executive" → concise summary, "developer" → code-focused prompt, etc.).
- Allow users to extend/customize these templates.

---

## 8. **Bias & Security Checks**

- If `bias_check=True`:
  Scan for loaded or stereotyped language; suggest rewording for neutrality.
- If `security_check=True`:
  Scan for prompt injection, sensitive data leakage, or risky patterns; warn as needed.

---

## 9. **Organizational Prompt Library**

- Optional:
  Add team-based shared prompt libraries, with tagging, best practices, and compliance notes, as described in the article.

---

## 10. **Documentation**

- Add a **Prompt Engineering Best Practices** section in docs:

  - What are prompt patterns and when to use them.
  - How to interpret diagnostics feedback.
  - Iterative refinement process.
  - Persona-based prompting examples.
  - Bias and security mitigation.

---

## 11. **Testing Requirements**

- Test each mode and feedback engine.
- Test CLI and SDK integration.
- Test that feedback is actionable and accurate.
- Test bias/security/length warnings.

---

## 12. **Sample Output**

- **Prompt:** “Discuss energy impacts.”
- **Diagnostics Output:**

  - Ambiguous—please specify type of energy, scope, and context.
  - Suggest: “Describe the impact of renewable energy on urban infrastructure in 2023, focusing on economic and environmental factors.”

---

## 13. **References and Attribution**

- Reference Sikha et al. (2023) in the docs and code.
- Optionally, include a “prompt optimized using best practices from Sikha et al., JEAST 2023” footer in outputs if diagnostics or patterns used.
